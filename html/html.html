        <h1>LEARNING TO CODE IN HTML</h1>
<p>
    <em>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.</em> With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.[2] Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

        <h2>HTML history</h2>
        <p><b>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based<span style="color:blue;font-weight:lighter"> Hypertext</span> system.Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes from 1990 he listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.</b>

        <h3>Current HTML Trends</h3>
        <p>Several sources show that HTML5 is gaining more traction among web developers, particularly in the Asia Pacific region. Dave Neal of UK-based The Inquirer wrote about a new survey conducted by Evan's Data, ("Developers are moving to HTML5") that shows that among 1,200 respondents the use of HTML5 is<b>between 40 and 60 percent</b>, and generates more of a buzz than say, Flash or Silverlight. <em>The percentage is significant given that several years ago there was little "buzz" at all about HTML5.</em>
